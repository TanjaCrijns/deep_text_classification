A Gentle Introduction to Text Classification with Deep Learning
=====

Description
-----

Deep learning has proven very effective for machine learning tasks in the past couple of years, but it is sometimes shrouded in jargon and unnecessary technical detail. This talk will provide a practical introduction to the topic focusing on building an end-to-end text classification system. No machine learning or deep learning experience required. Intermediate knowledge of Python required.


Abstract
-----
If you wondered what all the hype about deep learning is about but haven't taken the leap to trying it yourself, this talk is for you. First, we'll cover the basics of Deep Learning, focusing on the general intuition of the process. Then get hands-on experience by analyzing common examples of text and training models to predict the category the text belongs to, for example whether a movie review is positive or negative. Along the way, you will learn the necessary machine learning and text processing concepts. We will be using the Keras package which provides a Pythonic way to build deep learning models.

Installation 
-------

It can be tricky setting up an environment, especially a Deep Learning environment. 

The strongly preferred method is with MiniConda:

1. Install Continuum MiniConda (https://conda.io/miniconda.html)
2. Run `conda env create --force`
3. Run `source activate dl`

This should install all necessary dependencies in a painless way.
